âœ… Setup Instructions in Unity:
Create an empty GameObject in your scene named ObjectPool.

Attach the ObjectPool script to it.

Define pools in the ObjectPool script via the Inspector.

Create prefabs (e.g., Bullet) and drag them into the prefab fields.

Tag them with a unique string (like "Bullet").

For custom spawn behavior, create a script implementing IPooledObject.
